# capstoneproject
I have attempted the first option from the given document for capstone project (automated response generation)
there are two files out of which project1 contains implementation while project.ipynb contains more indepth and fine tuned model but I wasnt able to train due to GPU units limitation but would also like to be considered 
Thank you for this amazing course. It was very well constructed as well executed
